A set of grooves for MMA (Musical Midi Accompaniment)

This repository contains a couple of grooves for MMA, the Musical Midi
Accompaniment program.

See https://www.mellowood.ca/mma/ for details on MMA.

### basicpick4

A basic 4/4 fingerpicking guitar.

See also https://github.com/sciurius/mma-plugins/fpp for a plugin that
makes fingerpicking easy.

### guitarballad4

This style implements GuitarBallad4, a bright acoustic guitar. It has
main strums on the beats, and reverse strums in between.

Time signature is 4/4.

For best results, use a warm sound font.

### neutral

A couple of 'neutral' grooves: Neutral34, Neutral44 and Neutral68,
mainly for developing songs.

Characteristics are:

* chords are legato (organ) and span full measures

* a simple drum pattern (sidekick plus closed highhat) plays the rhythm

You can hear the chords and progressions, feel the rhythm, without
extra instruments and articulations and ornaments getting in the way.

The neutral grooves come for times 3/4 (ONE two three), 4/4 (ONE two
three four) and 6/8 (ONE two three FOUR five six).

### risingsun

This style implements RisingSun, the strum pattern made eternally
famous 55 years ago by the Animals in their version of The House Of
The Rising Sun.

The style consists of three grooves with identical strumming but a
different bass note.
